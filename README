JavaScript Calculator with Keypad Input
This project is a simple JavaScript calculator that allows users to input mathematical expressions through a custom keypad interface. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, percentages, square roots, toggling between positive and negative values, and can recall the previous answer.

Features
Basic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Percentage Calculation: Automatically interprets numbers followed by % as percentages.
Square Root Calculation: Recognizes expressions starting with √ and evaluates them as square roots.
Clear and Delete: Clear the entire input or delete the last character.
Previous Answer Recall: Use the result of the last calculation in the current expression.
Positive/Negative Toggle: Toggle between positive and negative values for the current input.
Code Structure
The core of the functionality is handled within an event listener that responds to button clicks on the custom keypad. Below are the primary parts of the code:

Variables
keys: Selects all elements with the .key class representing calculator buttons.
inputBox: Represents the input field where the user sees the current expression.
previous: Displays the previous expression before calculating the result.
inputString: Holds the current input as a string to be evaluated.
previousAnswer: Stores the answer of the last calculation for future recall.
Button Event Handling
The code uses a forEach loop to attach click event listeners to each button in keys. Based on the button ID (btn.id), it performs specific actions:

Clear Button (id="clear"): Clears all input from the inputBox and previous.
Delete Button (id="del"): Deletes the last character in inputString.
Equal Button (id="="):
Displays the current expression in the previous element.
Replaces % with division by 100 for percentage calculations.
Replaces √ followed by a number with Math.sqrt(number) for square root calculations.
Evaluates the expression using eval() and displays the result in inputBox.
Stores the result in previousAnswer.
Answer Recall (id="ans"): Appends the previousAnswer to the current expression.
Positive/Negative Toggle (id="+/-"): Toggles the sign of the current input.
Other Inputs: Appends numbers and operators to inputString and displays it in inputBox.
